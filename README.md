#Take home interview assignment
This is a repository of scripts and code for a take home assignment
##Structure
Each folder has it's own README.md that provides details on each project
* Prerequisites and Installation
* Design Decisions and Assumptions
* Other Considerations and changes that could be made
###Chef
Folder: chef-repo/cookbooks/teradici
###Ruby
1. rubysocket - Simple Socket Server that returns the reversed string input
2. rubywordcount - Counts the occurrences of words in a text file and outputs the top ten word count

2. psinstalledapps - Lists the installed apps on a windows computer. 2 implementations are provided
3. pseventlogs - Takes yesterday's System Event Log and outputs to a CSV file
##Timing
This is a rough estimate of the time spent on each section by:
* Research
* Thinking (Architecture and Design)
* Coding & Testing
* Documentation
###Chef
Building the packer-templates took sometime but did not impact actual time spent
* Research (1h)
* Thinking (0.5h)
* Coding (1h)
* Documentation (0.5h)
###Ruby
As I only have minimal experience with Ruby, there was a lot of time spent on getting the right syntax and coding patterns. The timings are consolidated for all three scripts
* Research (1.5h)
* Thinking (0.5h)
* Coding (1.5h)
* Documentation (0.5h)
###Powershell
* Research (1h)
* Thinking (0.5h)
* Coding (1h)
* Documentation (0.5h)
###Total Time Spent
Total time spent was about 10 hours.
